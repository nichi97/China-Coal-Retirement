# China Coal Plants Retirement Exploration

## Introduction

This project investigates what factors determine coal-fired power plants early retirements in China.

## Project tasks

-   [x] Wrangle raw data set to get to master data frame
-   [x] Do initial visualization on retirement patterns in China by year
-   [ ] Explore geographic pattern of retirement
-   [ ] Create a Shiny visualization platform to present the retirement pattern
-   [ ] Create some hypotheses
-   [ ] Validate / disprove hypotheses
-   [ ] Maybe I can separate natural retirement and early retirement. 
-   [ ] Characterize each phase better. Explore what caused the shifts in 
phase change. 

## Questions
-   [ ] Why 2007~2010 has seen such a high rate of coal plants retirements? 
How do these retired plants look like? 
-   [ ] Why sudden drop in retirement rate in 2021 and 2022? Is that a data 
collection issue or is that an actual trend? 

## Processed Data 

### cumulative_cap.csv

Cumulative coal generation capacity from year 1953 to 2023. Unit: MW

### retired_china_units.csv

Coal units that are retired as of 2023. 

## Log

### 1/27/2023

-   Finish initial data wrangling, code in 1_data_wrangle.R
-   Did some visualization to see retirement pattern in China by year.
-   Still working on coming up with a cumulative coal generation capacity by year this way, I can see retirement pattern by share of existing coal capacity. But this is harder than I expected... Will continue tomorrow.

### 1/29/2023

-   Completed cumulative capacity data wrangling.
-   Exploratory analysis -- looking into years with NAs. Data seems pretty completed. Only ~90 units are currently operating with no operation start dates
-   Keep track of created data sets in README.md now.
-   Completed retirement rate over time plot
